# Why?

While designing on a hackathon project, I used `figma` standard web frame dimensions...

but, guess what while i coded out the designs, the results turned out to be `out-of-proportions`

so here's a design tool that gives you accurate dimensions for code

> figma gives you dimensions in `px` and not `rem`, so the term `responsive design is kinda not true`
